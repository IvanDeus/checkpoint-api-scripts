### ‚úÖ Purpose:
This script creates **Access Roles** in a Check Point Firewall using data from a JSON file. It connects to the Check Point Management Server via the API, logs in, creates roles based on the input JSON data, publishes the changes, and logs out.

Each Access Role is defined with a name and associated networks (by name), with default permissions set to allow "any" for machines, remote access clients, and users.
