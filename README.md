# checkpoint-api-scripts
Check Point firewall management API add or modify multiple objects api scripts
cpapi required, can run directly from R8x.xx management machine

---

## üìÑ Script: `addaccessrolefromfile.py`

### ‚úÖ Purpose:
This script creates **Access Roles** in a Check Point Firewall using data from a JSON file. It connects to the Check Point Management Server via the API, logs in, creates roles based on the input JSON data, publishes the changes, and logs out.

Each Access Role is defined with a name and associated networks (by name), with default permissions set to allow "any" for machines, remote access clients, and users.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage Example

### Command Line:
```bash
python addaccessrolefromfile.py <server> <username> <password> <json_file>
```

### Example:
```bash
python addaccessrolefromfile.py 192.168.1.10 admin securepass123 access_roles.json
```

Where:
- `192.168.1.10` ‚Äì IP address of your Check Point Management Server
- `admin` ‚Äì administrator username
- `securepass123` ‚Äì password for the user
- `access_roles.json` ‚Äì path to the JSON file containing access role definitions

---

## üìÅ Input File Format (`access_roles.json`)

Each object in the JSON array must include `"Access Role"` and `"Networks"` keys:

```json
[
    {
        "Access Role": "HR_Access_Role",
        "Networks": [
            {"name": "HR_Network_1"},
            {"name": "HR_Network_2"}
        ]
    },
    {
        "Access Role": "DevTeam_Access_Role",
        "Networks": [
            {"name": "Development_Network"}
        ]
    }
]
```

---

## üßæ What the Script Does:

1. Logs into the Check Point Management Server.
2. Iterates through each access role definition in the JSON file.
3. Creates an access role linked to specified network objects.
4. Publishes all changes.
5. Logs out from the session.

---

## üìÑ Script: `addoneaccrolewithnetnldapgrp.py`

### ‚úÖ Purpose:
This script creates a **single Access Role** in a Check Point Firewall with specific network access and LDAP-based user group restrictions using the Check Point Management API.

It is useful for scenarios where you want to define an access role that allows access only to certain networks and restricts users to a specific LDAP group.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage Example

### Command Line:
> **Note:** This script is **hardcoded**, meaning most parameters like server, username, password, and role details are defined inside the script. You can optionally modify it to accept command-line arguments.

```bash
python addoneaccrolewithnetnldapgrp.py
```

### Example Output:
```bash
{'name': 'r017', 'machines': 'any', 'networks': ['hub(1.1.2.1)', 'Net10-8'], 'remote-access-clients': 'any', 'users': {'source': 'bnk', 'selection': 'SecFW_2', 'base-dn': 'OU=GroupsFW,OU=GEN3,OU=Ka,DC=bnk,DC=com'}}
New access role 'r017' created successfully.
Changes published successfully.
```

---

## üìÅ Configuration Inside Script

The following variables are hardcoded and should be edited directly in the script:

```python
server = "localhost"  # IP of Check Point Management Server
username = "admin"    # Admin username
password = "111"      # Admin password
new_access_role_name = "r017"  # Name of new access role
```

The access role will be configured with:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Machines | any |
| Networks | `hub(1.1.2.1)`, `Net10-8` |
| Remote Access Clients | any |
| Users (LDAP) | Source: `bnk`, Selection: `SecFW_2`, Base DN: `OU=GroupsFW,OU=GEN3,OU=Ka,DC=bnk,DC=com` |

---

## üßæ What the Script Does:

1. Connects to the local or remote Check Point Management Server.
2. Logs in with provided credentials.
3. Creates one access role with:
   - Specified name
   - Network access to listed objects
   - LDAP-based user group restriction
4. Publishes the session to apply changes.
5. Logs out from the session.

---

## üìÑ Script: `getldapgrpsfromaccessroles.py`

### ‚úÖ Purpose:
This script retrieves **Access Roles** from a Check Point Firewall using the Management API and extracts **LDAP user group information** associated with each role. It outputs or saves the data in a structured JSON format that can be used later to recreate or modify access roles using another script (e.g., `addaccessrolefromfile.py`).

It supports pagination to handle large environments and allows saving output to a file.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage Example

### Command Line:
```bash
python getldapgrpsfromaccessroles.py <server> <username> <password> [--save <output_file.json>]

```bash
python getldapgrpsfromaccessroles.py 192.168.1.10 admin securepass123
```

### Example 2 ‚Äì Save Output to File:
```bash
python getldapgrpsfromaccessroles.py 192.168.1.10 admin securepass123 --save access_roles_ldap.json
```

Where:
- `192.168.1.10` ‚Äì IP address of your Check Point Management Server
- `admin` ‚Äì administrator username
- `securepass123` ‚Äì password for the user
- `--save` (optional) ‚Äì save the result into a JSON file instead of printing it

---

## üìÅ Output Format (`access_roles_ldap.json`)

The output will be an array containing each access role and its associated LDAP users/groups:

```json
[
    {
        "Access Role": "HR_Access",
        "Users": [
            {
                "name": "SecTeam",
                "cn": "SecTeam",
                "dn": "OU=Security,DC=example,DC=com"
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "Access Role": "Dev_Access",
        "Users": [
            {
                "name": "Developers",
