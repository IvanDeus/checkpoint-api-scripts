# checkpoint-api-scripts
Check Point firewall management API scripts collection to add or modify multiple objects. Can run directly from a  R8x.xx management machine. 

## Requirements 

Official Check Point [cpapi library] (https://github.com/CheckPointSW/cp_mgmt_api_python_sdk).

---

## üìÑ Script: `addaccessrolefromfile.py`

### ‚úÖ Purpose:
This script creates **Access Roles** in a Check Point Firewall using data from a JSON file. It connects to the Check Point Management Server via the API, logs in, creates roles based on the input JSON data, publishes the changes, and logs out.

Each Access Role is defined with a name and associated networks (by name), with default permissions set to allow "any" for machines, remote access clients, and users.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage Example

### Command Line:
```bash
python addaccessrolefromfile.py <server> <username> <password> <json_file>
```

### Example:
```bash
python addaccessrolefromfile.py 192.168.1.10 admin securepass123 access_roles.json
```

Where:
- `192.168.1.10` ‚Äì IP address of your Check Point Management Server
- `admin` ‚Äì administrator username
- `securepass123` ‚Äì password for the user
- `access_roles.json` ‚Äì path to the JSON file containing access role definitions

---

## üìÅ Input File Format (`access_roles.json`)

Each object in the JSON array must include `"Access Role"` and `"Networks"` keys:

```json
[
    {
        "Access Role": "HR_Access_Role",
        "Networks": [
            {"name": "HR_Network_1"},
            {"name": "HR_Network_2"}
        ]
    },
    {
        "Access Role": "DevTeam_Access_Role",
        "Networks": [
            {"name": "Development_Network"}
        ]
    }
]
```

---

## üßæ What the Script Does:

1. Logs into the Check Point Management Server.
2. Iterates through each access role definition in the JSON file.
3. Creates an access role linked to specified network objects.
4. Publishes all changes.
5. Logs out from the session.

---

## üìÑ Script: `addoneaccrolewithnetnldapgrp.py`

### ‚úÖ Purpose:
This script creates a **single Access Role** in a Check Point Firewall with specific network access and LDAP-based user group restrictions using the Check Point Management API.

It is useful for scenarios where you want to define an access role that allows access only to certain networks and restricts users to a specific LDAP group.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage Example

### Command Line:
> **Note:** This script is **hardcoded**, meaning most parameters like server, username, password, and role details are defined inside the script. You can optionally modify it to accept command-line arguments.

```bash
python addoneaccrolewithnetnldapgrp.py
```

### Example Output:
```bash
{'name': 'r017', 'machines': 'any', 'networks': ['hub(1.1.2.1)', 'Net10-8'], 'remote-access-clients': 'any', 'users': {'source': 'bnk', 'selection': 'SecFW_2', 'base-dn': 'OU=GroupsFW,OU=GEN3,OU=Ka,DC=bnk,DC=com'}}
New access role 'r017' created successfully.
Changes published successfully.
```

---

## üìÅ Configuration Inside Script

The following variables are hardcoded and should be edited directly in the script:

```python
server = "localhost"  # IP of Check Point Management Server
username = "admin"    # Admin username
password = "111"      # Admin password
new_access_role_name = "r017"  # Name of new access role
```

The access role will be configured with:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Machines | any |
| Networks | `hub(1.1.2.1)`, `Net10-8` |
| Remote Access Clients | any |
| Users (LDAP) | Source: `bnk`, Selection: `SecFW_2`, Base DN: `OU=GroupsFW,OU=GEN3,OU=Ka,DC=bnk,DC=com` |

---

## üßæ What the Script Does:

1. Connects to the local or remote Check Point Management Server.
2. Logs in with provided credentials.
3. Creates one access role with:
   - Specified name
   - Network access to listed objects
   - LDAP-based user group restriction
4. Publishes the session to apply changes.
5. Logs out from the session.

---

## üìÑ Script: `getldapgrpsfromaccessroles.py`

### ‚úÖ Purpose:
This script retrieves **Access Roles** from a Check Point Firewall using the Management API and extracts **LDAP user group information** associated with each role. It outputs or saves the data in a structured JSON format that can be used later to recreate or modify access roles using another script (e.g., `addaccessrolefromfile.py`).

It supports pagination to handle large environments and allows saving output to a file.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage Example

### Command Line:
```bash
python getldapgrpsfromaccessroles.py <server> <username> <password> [--save <output_file.json>]

```bash
python getldapgrpsfromaccessroles.py 192.168.1.10 admin securepass123
```

### Example 2 ‚Äì Save Output to File:
```bash
python getldapgrpsfromaccessroles.py 192.168.1.10 admin securepass123 --save access_roles_ldap.json
```

Where:
- `192.168.1.10` ‚Äì IP address of your Check Point Management Server
- `admin` ‚Äì administrator username
- `securepass123` ‚Äì password for the user
- `--save` (optional) ‚Äì save the result into a JSON file instead of printing it

---

## üìÅ Output Format (`access_roles_ldap.json`)

The output will be an array containing each access role and its associated LDAP users/groups:

```json
[
    {
        "Access Role": "HR_Access",
        "Users": [
            {
                "name": "SecTeam",
                "cn": "SecTeam",
                "dn": "OU=Security,DC=example,DC=com"
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "Access Role": "Dev_Access",

- You can automate this in CI/CD pipelines or scheduled tasks for consistent policy enforcement.

---

## üìÑ Script: `setoneaccrolewithldapgrp.py`

### ‚úÖ Purpose:
This script updates a **single Access Role** in a Check Point Firewall, setting its associated **LDAP user groups** using the Management API. It allows specifying multiple LDAP groups from the same domain and applies them to an existing access role.

It is useful for scenarios where you want to:
- Assign or update LDAP-based user restrictions for a specific access role.
- Apply changes directly on a Check Point R8x management server.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage Example

### Command Line:
> **Note:** This script is **hardcoded**, meaning most parameters like server, username, password, and access role settings are defined inside the script.

```bash
python setoneaccrolewithldapgrp.py
```

### Example Output:
```bash
{'name': 'rol11', 'users': [{'source': 'bank', 'selection': 'SecFW_31', 'base-dn': 'OU=GroupsFW,OU=GEN3,OU=Ka,DC=bank,DC=com'}, {'source': 'bank', 'selection': 'SecFW_33', 'base-dn': 'OU=GroupsFW,OU=GEN3,OU=Ka,DC=bank,DC=com'}]}
Access role 'rol11' updated successfully.
Changes published successfully.
```

---

## üìÅ Configuration Inside Script

The following variables are hardcoded and should be edited directly in the script:

```python
server = "localhost"  # IP of Check Point Management Server
username = "admin"    # Admin username
password = "123123"   # Admin password
new_access_role_name = "rol11"  # Name of the access role to update
```

The access role will be updated with the following LDAP users/groups:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Source | `bank` (must match an existing LDAP domain) |
| Selection(s) | `SecFW_31`, `SecFW_33` |
| Base DN | `OU=GroupsFW,OU=GEN3,OU=Ka,DC=bank,DC=com` |

---

## üßæ What the Script Does:

1. Connects to the local or remote Check Point Management Server.
2. Logs in with provided credentials.
3. Updates the specified access role with new LDAP-based user group definitions.
4. Publishes the session to apply changes.
5. Logs out from the session.

---

## üìÑ Script: `shownetworkobjects.py`

### ‚úÖ Purpose:
This script retrieves and prints network objects (such as hosts, networks, groups, etc.) from a Check Point Firewall using the Management API. It supports filtering by object type and can either include or exclude specified types using the `--negate` flag.

It is useful for:
- Auditing existing network objects
- Listing specific object types (e.g., only `host`, `network`, or `group`)
- Discovering UIDs of objects needed for other automation scripts

Supports pagination to handle large environments with many objects.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage Example

### Command Line:
```bash
python shownetworkobjects.py <server> <username> <password> <obj_types> [--negate]
```

```bash
python shownetworkobjects.py 192.168.1.10 admin securepass123 any
```

### Example 2 ‚Äì Show Only Host and Network Objects:
```bash
python shownetworkobjects.py 192.168.1.10 admin securepass123 host,network
```

### Example 3 ‚Äì Exclude Host Objects:
```bash
python shownetworkobjects.py 192.168.1.10 admin securepass123 host --negate
```

Where:
- `192.168.1.10` ‚Äì IP address of your Check Point Management Server
- `admin` ‚Äì administrator username
- `securepass123` ‚Äì password for the user
- `<obj_types>` ‚Äì comma-separated list of object types (e.g., `host`, `network`, `group`, `any`)
- `--negate` (optional) ‚Äì show all objects **except** those of the specified types

---

## üìÅ Sample Output:

```bash
Objects of Types: host, network
UID: 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000, Name: Web_Server, Type: host

UID: abcdef12-3456-7890-abcd-ef1234567890, Name: DMZ_Network, Type: network
```

Each line includes:
- `UID`: Unique identifier of the object (useful for API calls)
- `Name`: Display name in Check Point
- `Type`: Object type (e.g., `host`, `network`, `group`, etc.)

---

## üßæ What the Script Does:

1. Logs into the Check Point Management Server.
2. Retrieves all network objects using pagination (supports large setups).
3. Filters the results based on provided object types (`host`, `network`, etc.).
4. Optionally excludes matching types if `--negate` is used.
5. Prints the list of matching objects to the console.
6. Logs out after completing the operation.
